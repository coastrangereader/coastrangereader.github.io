<p>I recently made a resolution to stop reading the news entirely. It was not out of a desire to become less cultured, or less responsible, but rather it began as a vague impression that reading the news was making me an unfocused and impotent creature. A creature too attached to storylines over which I had rather little agency. From there, it grew into a suspicion that the problem was not <em>the</em> news, but <em>which</em> news. In other words, my attention at the time was directed expressly at world and national affairs. While I could articulate with some clarity the latest scandal occurring in Washington, I was ignorant as to the major changes in the coast range region of Oregon where I live.</p>

<p>And so I shifted my attention.</p>

<p>I began by trying to place the coast range within the world as a whole. What is our role? How are we changing? In what ways is our culture commendable, and in what ways are we blind? I also tried to learn something about patterns in commerce, education, community, and so forth. The things that would ordinarily appear from time to time in a local newspaper.</p>

<p>Talk a bit more about the value of literary ideas, stories, artifacts, pictures. Bower bird stuff.</p>

<p>Still figuring out the purpose of this magazine. It should be more of a literary and artistic publication than a news source. But it should permit rapid, low-resolution posts as well as longer essay-like posts. I like the structure of the prairie home companion â€“ but as a magazine. Anyways, writing the rest of this post will allow me to clarify such things.</p>
