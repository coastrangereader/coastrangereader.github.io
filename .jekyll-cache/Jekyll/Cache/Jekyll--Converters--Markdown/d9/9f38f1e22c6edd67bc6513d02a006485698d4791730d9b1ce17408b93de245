<h2 id="some-theory">Some Theory</h2>

<p>I recently made a resolution to stop reading the news entirely. It was not out of a desire to become less cultured, or less responsible, but rather it began as a vague impression that reading the news was making me an unfocused and impotent creature. A creature too attached to storylines over which I had rather little agency. From there, it grew into a suspicion that the problem was not <em>the</em> news, but <em>which</em> news. In other words, my attention at the time was directed expressly at world and national affairs. While I could articulate with some clarity the latest scandal occurring in Washington, I was ignorant as to the major changes in the coast range region or Oregon where I live.</p>

<p>And so I resolved to learn something about these affairs.</p>

<p>I began by trying to place the coast range within the world as a whole. What is our role? How are we changing? In what ways is our culture commendable, and in what ways are we blind? Iâ€™ve also tried to learn something about patterns in commerce, education, community, and so forth. The things that would ordinarily appear from time to time in a local newspaper.</p>
